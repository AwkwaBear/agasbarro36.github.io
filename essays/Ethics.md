## Military Communcations
Military bootcamp is designed to take any ordinary group of civilians and by the end of an 8 week period turn them into a cohesive unit that can operate efficiently as a team. You'd think that with only an 8 week period to do this that all of the training would be relevant to miltary operations and learning everything you can about the organization you are about to work for, maybe learn about guns and stuff, but that isn't actually the case. The first couple weeks of bootcamp are filled with things you wouldn't expect, mostly re-learning how to write letters and redefining basic words. You are handed a worksheet with letters to trace much like when you first learned to write in elementary school. Each of the letters are in all caps and printed in block lettering as shown below
<blockquote>
  A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
  </blockquote>
  
The same goes for numbers being re-learned. Eights are required to be written as they looked when typed in this font '8', written in two stacked circles like segments of a snowman rather than the figure eight style many people may have learned to write it as. You are told that the letter 'A' is pronounced "Alpha" and 'B' pronounced "Bravo". A "floor" is called a "deck",  a "wall" is now a "bulkhead", and a "door" is now a "hatch." Any time you deviated from these new established norms was met swiftly with punishment. 

A lot of it feels pretty insulting to your intelligence like you're wasting your time on childish nonsense.
I kept thinking "Why all of this focus on such trivial stuff? Are they just trying to make up crap so they can punish us?"

As you can imagine, the transition is pretty painful changing the way you've written and talked your entire life but after a week or so of getting "dropped" for messing up, your habits change pretty quick. It isn't until later in your career you realize why all this miniscule stuff was important. 

The reason you all have to re-learn how to write is because everything in the military is logged, most of it by hand. People's handwritings all span a pretty large range but if you force everyone to write in block lettering print, even with terrible handwriting it should be understandable. The wording people use is also important because when you standardize terms, definitions, and phrases, you don't run into situations where people have to ask what some one else means. Effective communication is usually the largest obstacle in any coordinated effort and the military has it down to an extreme science. The difference between the military and most organizations is that they have the luxury of being expected and able to break down and rebuild the foundational practices of each person who joins through an institutionalization process.

## How could this even be relevant to ESLint

ESLint is the civilian/coding equivalent to a drill instructor yelling at you when you violate an order. It is nice little plugin that provides a gentle (but effective) bit of feedback in the form of an IDE warning when a standardized practice is broken. The way that some one likes to indent their functions, place line breaks, and space brackets is essentially your coding "handwriting." We each have different ways we were taught to do it and its not always easier to read some one else's. Coding standards being established ,such as AirBnB's, ensures that everyone will use the same syntax and formatting for their code ensuring that multiple people can work on the same project and can easily follow what they are doing. It is the same as the military's standardization of handwriting, words, and phrases. But established standards are nothing if people aren't held to them and that is why ESLint is such a thing of beauty. It keeps you accountable to ensure you aren't deviating from your teams agreed method of code communications. Adherence to the standards are rewarded with a green check mark in the corner of the IDE. With everyone on the same page it makes it easier to identify actual issues in the code rather than trying to translate a garbled mess of sloppy indents. This military-precision-like coding team, level of cohesion can be achieved only through our dedication to individual pursuits of that sweet zesty green check mark.
