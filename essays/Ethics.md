## Impact of Modern Software

In the last few decades, software applications have gone from a infrequent source of entertainment to a constant method we rely upon for receiving and exchanging information. The average American spends 11 hours per day interacting with computer software or watching videos on a screen. Modern applications have created opportunities immediate worldwide spread of information which walks a razors edge of helping or harming society as a whole. The internet has given people the opportunity to create positive change through things like kickstarter campaigns for people who can't afford organ transplants and fundraising for people who are affected by natural disasters. But the capability for anyone to gain a platform that can rapidly be shared and spread creates a powerful tool that can be used for good. People can spread misinformation movements that can rapidly gain traction and cause real harm through propegandizing misleading information. Two major movements that have risen in the last few years are the anti-vaccination and flat Earth communities. Despite the initially published anti-vaccination study being quickly determined to be scientifically completely incorrect and the doctor who published the study having his license removed, this movement has grown to the point where a measles, a disease completely erradicated in the United States, has had almost 300 cases of measles due to a community of people who refuse to vaccinate their children. The flat earth theory, while not directly a cause of any danger, promotes a general distrust of the scientific community and encourages people to accept incorrect assumtions based on shoddy application of the scientific method. The effects of software engineers who create these platforms that anyone can stand upon and yell out to the world must also keep in mind that with great power comes create responsibility.
