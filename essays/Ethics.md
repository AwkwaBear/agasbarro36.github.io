## Impact of Modern Software

In the last few decades, software applications have gone from a infrequent source of entertainment to a constant method we rely upon for receiving and exchanging information. The average American spends 11 hours per day interacting with computer software or watching videos on a screen. Modern applications have created opportunities immediate worldwide spread of information which walks a razors edge of helping or harming society as a whole. The internet has given people the opportunity to create positive change through things like kickstarter campaigns for people who can't afford organ transplants and fundraising for people who are affected by natural disasters. But the capability for anyone to gain a platform that can rapidly be shared and spread creates a powerful tool that can be used for good. People can spread misinformation movements that can rapidly gain traction and cause real harm through propegandizing misleading information. Two major movements that have risen in the last few years are the anti-vaccination and flat Earth communities. Despite the initially published anti-vaccination study being quickly determined to be scientifically completely incorrect and the doctor who published the study having his license removed, this movement has grown to the point where a measles, a disease completely erradicated in the United States, has had almost 300 cases of measles due to a community of people who refuse to vaccinate their children. The flat earth theory, while not directly a cause of any danger, promotes a general distrust of the scientific community and encourages people to accept incorrect assumtions based on shoddy application of the scientific method. The effects of software engineers who create these platforms that anyone can stand upon and yell out to the world must also keep in mind that with great power comes create responsibility.

## Ethics in Software Engineering
The Association for Computing Machinery has put much thought into the great power that computing technologies wield and as a result, has created a code of ethics to guide the community so that they may not create tools that will be used to cause great harm. The code of ethics is broken up into 3 sections the first of which is the general ethical principles. The general ethical principles establish that all people are stakeholders in computing. The privacy and rights of those stakeholders being maintained are the duty of the engineer who create the technologies we rely on every day. The second section is dedicated to the professional responsibilities of an engineer. A software engineer must strive for excellence and work only in areas of competence. They must also strive to ensure this high level of quality through providing and receiving peer review on works created. The third section about to promoting the health of an organization and its members by ensuring that whether something will cause harm to their overall wellness is taken into account when decisions are being made. This includes making ensuring that the current publics' reliance on a system factored when making a change that will affect the existing user base's ability to continue to rely on that system. The final section regards the duty of the computing professional to uphold and promote the code along with the way they should handle any violation of its principles. 

Software engineering allows for a small group of people to make a huge impact whether it be positive or negative. The Code of Ethics gives guidance as to how a computing professional should conduct themselves and make decisions to the greatest benefit of the common good. Through regular review of these principles and practice of their maxims, the we can prevent the problems of tomorrow today.
