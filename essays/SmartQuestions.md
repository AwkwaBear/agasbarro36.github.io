## How To Ask Questions the Smart Way
Eric Stephen Raymond's essay on proper formatting of questions when asking the programming community comes off a little condescending and has a whiff of gatekeeping but that does not make the content of the writing any less true. The essay serves as a guide to newcomers to the programming community and how to approach the more senior members of the field in a way that will make them likely to help you. Raymond emphasizes the importance of trying to make all possible effort to solve your problem on your own and to show that effort when coming with your hat in your hand to an expert who can provide you some guidance. The importance of showing an effort before you "give up" and ask for outside help when cannot be understated.

## Relating to a Different Field
In a past life, I worked as a senior supervisor leading nuclear plant operations on a submarine. The first thing always taught in our community is that no one owes you an answer to anything. When new operators encountered problems in their troubleshooting efforts, how willing senior personnel are to take time away from their responsibilities was entirely dependent on the willingness a junior person is to try to solve it on their own. It was more than a method of discouraging the mentality of feeling entitled to a questions answer, it was to aid in the learning process. I think back to when I was a junior operator and the problems I encountered and struggled with. The longer a problem takes to solve, the longer the lesson of finding the proper answer sticks with you. However, when you think of the times that you did not know how to evaluate a particular problem and a senior person simply gives you instructions you do not understand to fix the issue, the solutions and concepts behind why that worked are often forgotten quickly. We were surrounded by a wealth of technical information on every sort of specification or theory manual that could be tangentially related to our work available to us. For new people in the field it can be totally overwhelming to get tasked to fix something you have little understanding of and have a database of conceptual information to dig through for an answer that won't even be a direct set of instructions. The only way you will learn all of it is to just start reading somewhere. When asked what the answer to a question was it was common practice to simply respond with a chapter number and title of a technical manual. Being on the receiving end of this is often frustrating because there are over 800 manuals in the plant each with 500-1000 pages and it often felt like you were being messed with. After reading the chapter, you would often come back still not fully understanding and just be asked more questions about the topic by the senior person. It was often through this process that a junior person will eventually arrive to the answer to their own question and also aquire a deeper understanding of the subject through having struggled for so long on it. This was crucial in the training of our engineers because it did not only teach you the answer to your question, it guided you to learn how to find the answer to your question. As the years go by and the senior members move on and leave the plant, you eventually find yourself having less and less people more senior than you to look to for answers. And one day you'll find yourself, in the middle of the ocean, responsible to tell the junior people what chapter to look in. By that time, you better know which chapter to look in because, if you can't solve the problem then no one can.
