## What is a UI Framework?

A UI Framework is a library of functions specifically developed to allow a developer to have an established structure to work with to create a user interface. This means that rather than trying to struggle with designing the core functions of page navigation and features, a developer can focus on layout and aesthetics knowing that the internals will work as desired.
