## What is a UI Framework?

A UI Framework is a library of functions specifically developed to allow a developer to have an established structure to work with to create a user interface. This means that rather than trying to struggle with designing the core functions of page navigation and features, a developer can focus on layout and aesthetics knowing that the internals will work as desired. Many webpages require the same types of features such as menu buttons, links to social media websites, or footers with contact us information. A smart developer would, after initially writing one of these, reuse the code when needed later on and then modify the code for the specific purpose. A UI framework is just a standardized library of reusable code that can be reformatted to fit the needs of each specific application. It can be thought of with an analogy of a carpenter making furniture. Many different pieces of furniture have pieces that are of similar functions that are used in various applications. For example, the carpenter could just make chairs and a tables from scratch every time or he could have a bunch of existing premade parts to furniture in his workshop. He could use premade wooden legs that can be fixed to a tabletop or modified to be used with a chair and save a ton of time crafting useable furniture. A UI framework basically gives you all the premade pieces you need in order to quickly assemble a user interface based on common elements of web pages.

## My Experience with Semantic UI

Semantic UI has given me the opportunity to be able to make a modern looking fully functional webpage within an hour or so without having much knowledge in CSS or HTML. The framework shifts much of the complicated syntax needed to be successful using CSS into simplified english phrases that are easy to pick up quickly. Need a red button? Type "red button" and one appears. If its too small just add the word "large" to the statement as a prefix and the framework will take care of the rest. It removes the need of fiddling around with guessing what you should adjust the size to in pixels in order to get everything to look the correct size. The framework has already standardized the sizes to keep everything looking relatively proper. Another big advantage has been the mobile first principle the framework takes into account. The browser being resized or accessed on a handheld device is not a problem as the framework has established norms on how to re organize itself to maintain the users experience intact. Semantic UI has allowed me to quickly create a webpage without having to grapple with trying to understand complicated syntax in a language I am unfamiliar with. It is a great tool that exponentially expands what you are capable creating in a very short amount of time.
