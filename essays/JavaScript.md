## Brief History
JavaScript was created in 1995 under the name "Mocha" by Brendan Eich, a programmer at Netscape. It was developed to be targetted toward web development as a platform. The goal was to use the internet as an application platform. Javascript was initially controversial for many of its features such as:

<blockquote>
  
-automatic semicolon insertion (ASI)
  
-automatic type coercion when using common operators like ‘==’

-lack of block scoping

-lack of classes

-lack of dedicated modularisation capability

-unusual inheritance (prototypical)
</blockquote>
These very features are what makes JavaScript such a great language for beginners to learn how to code in.


## Reflecting on my time using JavaScript
JavaScript is relatively new form of coding and because of that, it is very user friendly. Older coding languages such as C require each line of code to exact in their syntax and matching of variable types. JavaScript is written for the modern human who makes mistakes. It is very forgiving in the way that it will make assumptions and correct little mistakes for you. For example, a line of code may be missing a semicolon at the end of a function call yet the Javascript compiler will make the correction and run properly anyways despite the small error. It allows for programmers to push onward with larger ideas than perfect robotic syntax and focus on issues like whether the algorithm they are implementing in the code is correct. The danger in these assumptions the compiler makes is that if one does not fully understand how they work, it can possibly produce a quandry to be overcome when debugging strange behavior. These are minor issues as overall; JavaScript seems to be very beginner accessible and convenient compared to other coding langauges coming from some coding experience.

## Athletic Software Engineering Pedagogy
The Athletic method of teaching software development skills is akin to the crossfit method of fitness. It is designed to produce rapid results with short high-intensity bursts of skill honing. In crossfit, a Workout Of the Day (WOD) is created with the intention of forcing the victim to complete a list of whole body intensive workouts. The list is to be completed either as fast as one can or are segmented into rapid high stress bursts. As some one who had stuck with a crossfit gym 3 times a week for over a year in the past, I can attest to the effectiveness of the methodology. 

I spent nearly every day before a crossfit meetup with that lingering dread that one feels when they have an essay due that night that has been procrastinated on for a month. Some days the workout would just a be laundry list of workouts that you could cheat yourself a little when you got tired and skip a couple reps or let your form slip. Other days it would be something like 10 burpees per minute for 60 minutes while being strictly timed and monitored. These workouts would push you to the point where you think "I'm gonna pass out. I know I'm gonna pass out. I just need to keep doing these till I pass out, then I'll finally get a break." But the thing about those workouts is, you never end up passing out. 

You learn that after this painful perfomance you put on in an amphitheatre of anguish, you're still standing. Every single one of these workouts tests your endurance while at the same time teaching you that your limits you have in your head are exactly that, in your head. Each day after the workout you feel 2-3% stronger than you did the time before. It doesn't seem like much but it adds up quickly if you stick with it. In very little time you see youself getting tired much later than before while doing workouts with more weight than before. This is the same principle behind the Athletic Software Engineering Pedagogy.

WOD in crossfit stands for "Workout of the Day" and also means the same thing in the Athletic Pedagogy. The WODs in software engineering are meant to act the same way as their crossfit counterparts. They provide a short burst of high intensity practice solving a Javascript coding problem. It is an effective methodology that is guaranteed to produce results by precluding the ability for students to take a backseat during lectures and delay focusing until a homework or exam. The stress of an upcoming WOD acts as motivation a to learn as there is a test of your dedication coming up within a day or two. 

Athletic Software Engineering's methods may be high stress and some students may not be able to handle it but is really a make or break system, which will "make" much more often than "break." The continuous string of upcoming challenges acts to motivate one into never letting their guard down. It encourages a strong level of understanding through necessity to have the tools required to critically think your way through a series of given problems over time. It does not teach a student self discipline, it simply gives them an environment where if they stay disciplined they will thrive. It emboldens a student to teach themself self-discipline, which ultimately is infinitely more powerful than the former.
