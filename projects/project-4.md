Make-A-Meal is a web application designed in semantic UI react to showcase an application that can support multiple users and perform personalized functions. The project was designed for a Software Engineering course as a final project using a combination of Meteor, React, Semantic UI, Javascript, and MongoDB. The stores a set of recipes in the Mongo database which can be filtered based on dietary restrictions and saved as a favorite recipe to a user's account. The application was created by three group members. My personal contribution was to plan the methods the recipes would be stored in the database, implement the schema's that the recipes would use, and setting up the methods through which recipe cards would be displayed. The project reinforced skills of project planning, group code conflict resolution, along with debugging and deploying a web application.
